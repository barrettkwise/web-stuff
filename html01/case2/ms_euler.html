    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

    <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
    <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
    he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean 
    Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
    and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
    Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
    publishing over <em> 800 different books and papers</em>. His 
    influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>
    
    <p>He is perhaps best known for his research into 
    mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
    <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</cite> (1748), 
    remained a standard textbook in the field for 
    well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
    he wrote <cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, 
    giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
    physical theories of the time.</p>
    
    <p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
    copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
    as <var>e</var> and &pi;, were introduced 
    in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
    leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
    certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

    <h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

    <p>Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:</p>
    
    <code>cos(x)+isin(x)=e<sup>xi</sup></code>
    
    <p>which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
    complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
    equation, it's easy to derive the identity:</p>
    
    <code>e<sup>&pi;</sup>i+1=0</code>
    
    which relates the fundamental constants: 
    <var>0, 1, &pi;, e, and i</var> in a single beautiful and 
    elegant statement. A poll of readers 
    conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite>
    magazine named Euler's Identity as the 
    most beautiful theorem in the history of 
    mathematics.
